### ðŸ”² What is Data?
Data is raw, unorganized facts that need to be processed. Data can be something simple and seemingly random and useless until it is organized.
### ðŸ”² What is Information?
If we arrange some data in an appropriate sequence, then it forms a Structure and gives us a meaning. This meaning is called Information . The basic unit of Information in Computer Science is a **bit**, **Binary Digit** .

So, we found two things in Information: One is **Data** and the other is **Structure** .

### ðŸ”² What is Data Structure?
1. A data structure is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data.
2. A data structure tries to structure data!
   * Usually more than one piece of data
   * Should define legal operations on the data
   * The data might be grouped together (e.g. in an linked list)
3. When we define a data structure we are in fact creating a new data type of our own.
    * i.e. using predefined types or previously user defined types.
    * Such new types are then used to reference variables type within a program

### ðŸ”² Why Data Structures?

1. Data structures study how data are stored in a computer so that operations can be implemented efficiently
2. Data structures are especially important when you have a large amount of information
3. Conceptual and concrete ways to organize data for efficient storage and manipulation.
